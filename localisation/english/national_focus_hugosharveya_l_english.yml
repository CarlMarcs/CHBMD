The Yugoslavian right were higly radicalised by both the SFR and now Hugosharveya, and have turned into Christian Fundamentalists. They are incredibly Islamophobic, and want to put the Middle East back into the rightful hands of Christianity. \n\n Then there is Harvey himself, trying to keep the middle ground. This is, however, very difficult, since even if one faction has slightly more influence, with this being the Balkhams, the powderkeg will explode. \n\nWith tensions getting worse, the three factions now all try to keep their ideas on top, will do anything to keep them there. \n\n§R Titoist Influence: [?YUG_Commie_Influence|0]§! \n§0 Crusadist Influence: [?YUG_Crusadist_Influence|0]§!"

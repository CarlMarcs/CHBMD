 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "A Milennium Defined by Schoolkids"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When people celebrated the new milennium on New Year's Day, they knew that change was afoot. But this was not the change they expected. Somehow, what was thought to be a normal Grammar School in the West Midlands had time travelled from the distant future of the 2020s to today. What will they do, with their futuristic technology, nobody knows. All anybody knows is that this will be a very different century than those before. There may be a cold war, there may not. There may be nuclear war, there may not. The people of the world can only hope that there will be peace."
 DEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark is in a safe and sound spot, being both a member of the EU and NATO. Internal economic downturn and slowdown have however been recently challenging the Danish state."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With Hong Kong handed over to China in 1997, the United Kingdom has seen its last great colonial possession go. The once mightiest nation on earth is trying desperately to find a new path to greatness and glory. But will that path lie in continued cooperation with the United States? Should Britain draw closer to its European brethren? Or shall Britannia, on her own, rule the waves once more?"
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown in 1974 and its subsequent communist dictatorship in 1991. The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption. It has also not resolved Ethiopia's ongoing conflict with Eritrea."
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the western European forces. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and is about to adopt the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sylvain Renault followed a similar fate to both Konstantin and Petra. He was also at home, but not at home. When the Blip happened, he got transported to France, where the people loved him for his wholesomeness, and willingly elected him in some 1999 snap elections. He now leads France, and its Italian ally, to the future"
 BAV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Petra Thomson was one fo the teachers that went on a little flight when the Blip happened. Luckily it was not far, only to Germany. South Germany too. She felt right at home, but, like her firends in Camp Hill proper, she had futuristic technology and an urge to conquer things. She marched on a Munich Beer hall, and declared herself the new leader of Thomsonia, controlling all former Bavarian land."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia has almost completely collapsed. After the 90s, the former SFR only managed to keep hold of Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. To make things worse, however, the Blip had got to them too. Hugo and Harvey Murray, once some normal kids, had blipped into Yugoslavia. Using their superior 2020s technology, they had managed to take over the weak nation. Hugo had preferred to stay out of politics, so Harvey has taken the helm. What direction will he take this new nation?"
 SCO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Many expected Daniel Redshaw to be the one blipped to Scotland. However, he wasn't. Jamie PAge, the Bagpipe Playing History and RS Teacher, was the one transported to Scotland. However, unlike many of the others transported outside of Camp Hill, he tries to keep many of the Camp Hillian systems, as well as the ones already put in place in his homeland of Scotland."
 BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Alongside Hugosharveya, The Balkhams has also came to be in the world. Mrs Kate Balkham (don't call her Miss) travelled to Bulgaria during the Blip, and, due to how weak it was after transitioning from communist rule, she took over, and beat the Tsarist pretender in the Bulgarian elections. There is a lot of tension between the Balkhams and Hugosharveya, to the point where some predict a 3rd Balkham war starting..."
 KAZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The last recorded place where a Camp Hill member landed was Kazakhstan. And, of course, the widest landing country got the widest landing teacher. Andy Taylor, once an ordinary Chemistry teacher, now leads the Kazakhs, and with his obese army, one day, possibly the world"
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Konstantin was not meant to be at Camp Hill for long. He was meant to leave before the end of the year. Sadly, he picked the wrong year. He got caught up in the Blip, and also travelled to the year 2000. Luckily, like Thomson in the south, he was in a homely place. He was back in Germany. To make things better, he didn't even need to revolt. His pure charisma led to the people electing him, and now he leads Konstantinople, ready to strike at Thomsonia"
 WAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Well, Conway came early. Tim Watkins has been managing Conway for years. When the Blip happened, it was clear where he was going to go. He appeared in Conway, half a year early this year. He managed to raise his army of sheep and take over Wales, declaring independence from the British. However, there are rumours that he is going insane, and the sheep are getting to him..."
 ICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In a hidden corner of Europe, Iceland has successfully kept a low profile since independence in 1944. Political conflicts with the British about fishing rights were perhaps the most exciting time in Icelandic history. Should Iceland take a more central stance?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A few days after Sylvain Renault appeared, he dissappeared. Then a totally unique figure, called Eduardo Lamborghini, appeared in Italy. He gained masses of Popular support, and wwon the 1999 snap elections. He now leads Italy, and its French ally, to the future"
 COK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Joanne Parmar loves coke. Diet Coke, specifically. She drinks 5 a day, to stay healthy. She was over the moon when she travelled to Georgia, home of Coca-Cola. Turns out, she was keeping their business afloat for the past few decades. They then decided to give her some high-energy coke as a reward. With this high energy coke, she felt a huge burst of energy, and knocked out the Georgia state governor. She then became the governor, and succeeded from the US"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan, the second-biggest economy on earth, has been the powerhouse of East Asian democracies ever since the Second World War ended. Backed by American and European allies and protected by a powerful industrial base, Japan looks at its old rival China with new confidence and new potential for conflict."
 NOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Norway voted against joining the European Union in 1995 and has subsequently stayed distant from Europe to some point. Norway however still remains a NATO member and shares a short but critical border with the Russian Federation."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "China, the backwater of yesterday, is the super power of tomorrow. Its industrial base great, its political influence growing, its military modernizing and its workforce nearly infinite, China has to fear only one thing: If it reforms too slowly, it might be destroyed. If it reforms too quickly, it might destroy itself."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Where China is the super power of tomorrow, India is the super power of next week. Its constant struggles against Pakistan and China as well as its deep economic connection to the west have given India a niche to prosper. If it is given enough time, the Tiger of South Asia will be strong enough to take out every single one of its enemies."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it was clear that the path back to glory would not be easy for the Russian Federation. The system and economy corrupt, the military big but outdated and the political outreach weakened, Russia had to accept to be on the sidelines for a decade. Now, it is looking to get back into the spotlight."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain has been on a long path of recovery. Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of falangism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; to Germany, France, Britain and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?"
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing only little to amend the issues. Sweden, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers."
 SWI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Neutral since times immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of not only NATO and the European Union, but also even the United Nations. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad in order to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?"
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The citizens of the United States have known little but victory in the last century. Winning the World Wars, winning the Cold War; the United States had a nearly perfect track record up until now. But with China emerging on the side of the ocean, with Russia pushing for renewed greatness, with terrorism an ever so great threat, what can America do to stay dominant?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Modern Day"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "With China claiming territorial waters around its coastlines, with Russia marching into Crimea, with the terrorist Islamic State proclaiming its caliphate, will the world stay the same? The United Kingdom is experiencing unwillingness to continue European integration. Recent terrorist attacks have the entirety of the French national principles shaken. Refugees are seeking shelter from wars and unrest in Syria and Libya. The next presidential election in the USA might be the most decisive one since 1940. The world is still changing."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The European Union is more unpopular than ever before. The British people are quick to blame everything wrong with their country on the officials in Brussels, as well as on the German government in Berlin. The population is deeply split around this one particular issue. Britain has recovered from the economic crisis of 2008 well, but leaving the European Union might destroy the economic progress of the past decade. And even then... is national sovereignity not preferable to minor economic gains?"
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "France has suffered from economic hardship and from major terrorist attacks in Paris. The French people grow increasingly antagonistic to their muslim and jewish minorities. The Front National is looking at a possibility to perhaps take power in these troubled times. Will the democratic establishment and French European integration prevail? Or will France stand on her own like in the good old days?"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Germany, hit by refugee crisis, economic hardship and growing internal resentment to countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, is still going strong. The European Union ever expands southwards. The European neighbors grow increasingly annoyed at Germany's policies. Is it worth it to continue that path? Or is it perhaps the time to revive border conflicts of old and let the soldiers march again?"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and as North Korean missiles are launched into the stratosphere. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has recently been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain the national security."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "No country of the G7 and the great four of Europe has been so strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2008 like Italy has. Recovery is slow and government support dwindling. The influx of African migrants is not helping at giving the people the image of internal stability. Italy needs to consider her choices. Surely this is not the time to revive imperialism, but drastic reforms will be necessary..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "China is very focussed on not letting her enemies not her weaknesses. Pollution, internal migration problems, a dwindling standard in the military, the ever corrupt governing body of the Communist Party. And yet, China is the giant of the east, the one that all the small countries fear. Japan, South Korea, the rebels in Taiwan, Vietnam... all of them united in their hatred for China. It is time for China to find a meaningful answer."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey ever-so unsuspecting."
 SPR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Like other Southern European countries, Spain has fallen into economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Kicked out of the G8, faced with massive economic sanctions, struggling with maintaining its sphere of influence, but at least reunited with its brethren on Crimea. That about sums up the situation of the Russian Federation since March of 2014. With the west now greatly antagonistic to Russia, it must consider either apologizing and retreating into its internationally acknowledged territory or it must find new allies. Beijing comes to mind."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Internally more divided than ever before, externally more challenged than any time since the Cold War ended. The United States is not living in a national golden age for sure. People are wary of Chinese aggression, of industrial problems and economic hardship, public support for American military alliances is fading. The next president of the United States will have to redefine what it means to be the greatest nation on earth, the land of the free and the home of the brave."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Crimea, the Islamic State, North Korean nuclear weapons. With conflict ever growing, the minor nations of the world need to find a way to either preserve peace or to destroy their enemies as quickly as possible."
 SUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Why am i even doing this anymore? Like, nobody ever reads this. Bla bla time travel, bla bla Harry v Red Impostor, bla bla Cock and Ball state. Anyway, if you read this, look at Khiva, it has a sussy shape"
 FE_RANDOMIZE_COUNTRY:0 "Random Country"
 PRK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "North Korea, a country that once did well, but soon became behind the times. Now, thanks to the Blip, they might stay there. Seema Mahmud, an unqualified Computing teacher at Camp Hill, landed in North Korea. Originally looking promising, she became leader, but now, her true colours show."
 KOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "South Korea is the polar opposite to North Korea, and Soth Computinga is the polar opposite to North Computinga. It is well developed, and developing furner, under the watchful eye of Nick Frost"

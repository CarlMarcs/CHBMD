Timothy Watkins has started to lose his mind, taking a more authoritarian turn, only allowing things he's certified. Ms Lamb, taking inspiration from her name, has declared herself a Sheep, and has formed the Welsh Republican Army, to send the 'Homo-Sapiens-Sapiens Colonisers' home. In reaction to this, Mr Butcher has also taken inspiration from his name, and has gone on mass slaughterings of sheep.

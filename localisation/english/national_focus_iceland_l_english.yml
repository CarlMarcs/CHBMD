 ICE_create_the_icelandic_navy_desc:0 "A coast guard will do us no good in the event of an actual war. We need a navy."
 ICE_create_the_icelandic_air_force:0 "Create the Icelandic Air Force"
 ICE_create_the_icelandic_air_force_desc:0 "We cannot rely on other nations to police our air for long, we must be self-sufficient."
 ICE_icelandic_panzer_forces:0 "Icelandic Armored Forces"

 ICE_fortress_iceland:0 "Fortress Iceland"
 ICE_fortress_iceland_desc:0 "We have the major defensive advantage of being an island in the freezing waters of the north, but that is not enough. We need to ensure we have defenses beyond that."

 ICE_icelandic_militias_desc:0 "Setting up small militias all over the island would go a long way in ensuring our defense."
 ICE_propose_an_alliance_to_sweden:0 "Propose an Alliance to Sweden"
 ICE_propose_an_alliance_to_sweden_desc:0 "Now that Iceland has chosen NATO to be unworthy, we need to perhaps consider an alliance of smaller scale with other countries that have so far elected to stay neutral. Sweden would be a formidable pick for our next big ally."
 ICE_befriend_russia:0 "Befriend Russia"
 ICE_befriend_russia_desc:0 "Now that we are taking distance from the United States and her allies, we should draw closer to America's adversaries to assure our position in this new world."

 ICE_invite_finland_desc:0 "Strengthening the Swedish-Icelandic alliance can only be done by involving more formerly neutral states. Finland is a great pick."
 ICE_befriend_china:0 "Befriend China"
 ICE_befriend_china_desc:0 "Far away and following a secret agenda of its own, China is a great and mysterious force to be reckoned with. However, its economic influence is rapidly increasing, and good relations with China might be a finite cake - and we need to get a slice of said cake."

 ICE_icelandic_warship_production:0 "Icelandic Warship Production"
 ICE_icelandic_warship_production_desc:0 "Militarizing the coast guard was a good first step in improving our navy, but it is not the last. We need to produce actual warships. We ARE an island, afterall."
 ICE_demand_greenlandic_independence:0 "Demand Greenlandic Independence"
 ICE_demand_greenlandic_independence_desc:0 "The biggest tragedy of the North Sea is that Denmark still maintains sovereignty over Greenland. We need to push them over the edge and force them to allow Greenland to leave."
 ICE_nordic_cooperation_programs:0 "Nordic Cooperation Programs"
 ICE_nordic_cooperation_programs_desc:0 "Iceland is not a major player on the world stage. We have chosen to stay out of faraway conflicts and have instead decided to focus on countries that are close us both geographically and diplomatically."
 ICE_befriend_norway:0 "Befriend Norway"

 ICE_befriend_the_baltic_states:0 "Befriend the Baltic States"
 ICE_befriend_the_baltic_states_desc:0 "Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania traditionally attempt to stay close to the Nordic Countries. We should welcome their approach with open arms."
 ICE_befriend_france:0 "Befriend France"
 ICE_befriend_france_desc:0 "France is a great potential market that the Icelandic importers and exporters are not yet tapping to the greatest of possibilities. We need to encourage a mutual expansion of markets."
 ICE_befriend_germany:0 "Befriend Germany"
 ICE_befriend_germany_desc:0 "Germany is Iceland's second most important origin of imports and fourth most important destination of exports. The Germans are the perhaps most politically influential force in western and central Europe and have a formidable diplomatic outreach. Having them as Iceland's friend would be a good idea."
 ICE_befriend_the_netherlands:0 "Befriend the Netherlands"
 ICE_befriend_the_netherlands_desc:0 "The Netherlands is far more vital to Iceland than might appear at first glance. Most of Iceland's exports to the European continent have to go through the port of Rotterdam, making the Netherlands Iceland's most important export destination at over a quarter of all exported goods, which puts them well ahead of the UK, Spain, Germany and France, the next most important partners."

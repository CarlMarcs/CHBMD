 chbfocus_initial_desc:0 "We are very different from other nations. For a start, our average age is around 15. We are also the youngest nation on this planet, as well as one of young dreamers. There's Zeeshan, the ultravisionary Leninist, who wants technological and extraterrestial progress. However, there is another growing force, the ASS, namely the pedos in that alliance. They want freedom too, only another type of freedom than the others."
 CHB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It was a normal day at Camp Hill, when there was a big bang. Things went from a normal day in 2022, to a very odd day. But it's still 2022, right? Wrong. Somehow, that bang travelled everyone to the year 2000. The head of the school then decided to use our superior futuristic technology to gain independence. After that, Garrod's leadership let to the seizing of Birmingham in our name. However, things are not as stable as they seem. The ASS are growing, the Students are angry, and there is a growing call for democracy, or even revolution, in our small state. Now, what will happen next?"
 CampHill.1.t:0 "How did we get here?"
 CampHill.1.d:0 "Well, this is a wild journey.\n\nIt all started normally, a normal school day, a normal form period. Then assembly came, and the Tech Team at Camp Hill were facing issues: the powerpoint couldn't load.\n\n The Tech team found a button which they thought would fix it: revert to older period. They clicked it, and there was a loud explosion. It didn't fix things. It exploded things.\n\nTeachers went to call the police, but their phones exploded too. So, instead of trying to contact outside, the school went into lockdown, and all technology was blocked, with one exception: the Dungeon, home of the Computing Room (and the plant room, but we aren't starting a drug empire, yet). Instead, the Computer Room was guarded by the strongest of the Rugby Team\n\nOne person thought this wasn't fair, and that person was Zeeshan. He snuck into the Computer Room through the Plant Room (after having some meth, as you do) and tried to find an old computer, since he likes old tech. Turns out, that old tech also showed the date, December 1st, 1999\n\nHe knew he had to be careful, so he went to his Maths lesson, as usual. He then thought he should mention this to his friends, just in case, but as usual, he was too loud. His Maths teacher, none other than the Head Himself, Martin Garrod, overheard this revelation, and called an emergency assembly. \n\n 'We are over 2 decades in the past, we are in 1999. As a school, we have the most advanced technology in the world right now. We should take advantage of this, and take land!'"
 CampHill.1.o1:0 "Yeah, ok whatever, just let me play."
 CampHill.1.o2:0 "What happened next?"
 CampHill.2.d:0 "The lockdown in the School was lifted, and plans were made for expansion. Using a rotary phone, the Head contacted all the other schools, uniting the King Edward VI Foundation under Camp Hill. The Rugby Squad, now united with other sports teams into the Alliance of Sporty Sweats, were given arms made by the science department, and told to march, and expand.\n\nWithin one day, Camp Hill had managed to occupy Birmingham, but this angered the British government, understandably\n\nThe Royal Army made a frontline around Birmingham, and was making plans to destroy the rebelling schoolkids\n\nAnyways, back in Camp Hill, The school tried to get more generals, so called a staff meeting. However, many teachers seemed to have disappeared. This ranged from Ms Parmar in English, to Mr Renault in French. Even the new German speaking assistant had dissappeared\n\n Turns out, after further outside contacts, these teachers hadn't just disappeared off the face of the earth, rather had been teleported across it. Some strategically useful teachers were Dr Jamie Paige in Scotland, and Timothy Watkins in Conway. Garrod contacted these teachers, and advised then to launch an insurrection in their own countries. The United Kingdom was now limited to England and Northern Ireland\n\nThe English were severely weakened, and forced into negotiations with Camp Hill. Camp Hill was granted all of Birmingham, and the United Kingdom was formally dismantled. There also had to be an open border between Camp Hill and England,\n\nBut just because the Camp Hill-British War was over, that didn't mean everything was stable. Although many were still loyal to the Staff Dictatorship, many had also split off. Zeeshan had formed the Proletarian Parties, which, for now, remain loyal to the staff, even if they are more independent. Although, the Alliance of Sporty Sweats have completely broke off, advocating for Camp Hill nationalism and mass expansion."

 CampHill.6.d:0 "Only 7 days into trying to plan elections, things have failed. Proletariat Paries claim that the elections are not truly democratic, and that the way they are set up does not represent the popular vote.
